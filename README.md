# Bank-Management_System
This project is a Bank Management System developed in Java, providing a simple simulation of basic banking operations such as creating accounts, managing customer information, depositing and withdrawing funds, and viewing transaction history.
Key Features:
Account Management: Create new accounts for customers with unique account numbers.
Deposit and Withdrawal: Perform deposit and withdrawal operations with validation checks.
Balance Inquiry: Check the balance of any account.
Transaction History: View the transaction history of deposits and withdrawals for each account.
Customer Details: Manage and update customer details (e.g., name, contact information).
How It Works:
The system stores customer and account data in memory.
Users can create new accounts, deposit funds, withdraw funds, and view their balance and transaction history.
Basic input validation and error handling are implemented for secure and consistent transactions.
The system operates in a console-based environment (command-line interface).
Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Java
Concepts Used: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File I/O (if applicable), Collections (ArrayLists, HashMaps)
IDE: Works with Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or any Java IDE. 
Future Improvements:
Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing.
Database integration for persistent account storage.
Adding user authentication for enhanced security.
